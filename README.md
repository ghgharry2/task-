# Overview of the  Project
This project is intended to offer a schedule management service in an organization by letting you manage your tasks and the tasks of your immediate subordinates. This means you can assign or change the tasks assigned to your subordinates and your own. In this project, I see a learning opportunity and I attempt to achieve all the functions in only two interfaces the authentication interface and main interface.
## Functions
### Authentication
The application offers an authentication service.
### Hierarchy 
We use the details provided during authentication and derive your immediate subordinates.
### Schedule management
We provide a service to achieve crud operations for the tasks.
